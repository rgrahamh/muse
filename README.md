# MUSE *(Musical Universal Serving Environment)* Planning

## ***Milestones:***

- *1/06*: Set up repository, begin discussing what kind of the network-layer
  protocol to use (or if we should make one in-house), what audio library to use,
  draw out the layout of the TUI, begin making a simple base interface with ncurses
  to get a better feel for the library.
- *1/08*: Be completely finished with initial planning, start working on the
  server application
- *1/17*: Have the server component and a client side listener fully set up &
  transmitting files; begin work on the client-side application & server TUI
- *1/24*: Finished with client-side application (can use the weekend if not on-
  time)
- *1/24-1/29*: Testing, Debugging, & poster-making
- *1/29*: Senior project finished; last day of work

## ***Goals:***



### *Set Goals:*

- Build a fully functional file server for MP3s
- Build an easy-to-use client for listening to music with basic playback functionality (play, skip, shuffle, make a queue, make a playlist, choose an existing playlist, etc.)
- Link the file server and music player so that the music is played remotely

### *Stretch Goals:*

- Support more audio file types (WAV, FLAC, etc.)
- Have an option to connect as admin (and ask for a password) to remotely change
  public playlists, add new music directories, and do other administrative activities
- Have an “internet radio” functionality where it shuffle plays a specified
  playlist
