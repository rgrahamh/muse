# SETUP
Before trying to build this application, you have to download the `ncurses` library. In order to do this, run this command if you have apt installed on your computer:
```
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
```
Or this if you have yum:
```
sudo yum install ncurses-devel
```
After this, you have to install the sqlite development libraries. To do this, run:
```
sudo apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev
```
